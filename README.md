# Navigation-Testing

Using this repository as a testing area because I have not been able to get React-Navigation running properly.

# What I did

I created a new react native project and installed React-Navigation. I started up the application with a little test screen. 
It could not find the gesture handler so I installed react-native-gesture-handler. It still shows that error

# Error info
Failed to load bundle with error:
